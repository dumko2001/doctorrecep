Step-by-Step Development Roadmap for Doctor Voice+Image Summary System

1. Project Setup & Infrastructure
Initialize Next.js monorepo with Tailwind CSS
Set up Supabase project: Postgres DB + Auth
Provision Cloud Run backend (Node.js/Express or Fastify recommended)
Configure environment variables and secure keys (Supabase, Gemini API keys)
2. Database Schema Design
Create doctors table (id, name, email, phone, auth info, template JSON)
Create submissions table (id, doctor_id FK, base64_audio, base64_image, status ENUM[pending, processed, approved], submitted_by ENUM[doctor, receptionist], created_at, updated_at)
Create templates table linked to doctor_id (prescription format, advice style, language tone, etc.)
Add indexes on doctor_id and status for quick filtering
3. Authentication
Implement Supabase email/password auth for doctors
Use JWT to secure API routes
Middleware to check doctor context on all routes
Single login per doctor for both mobile and desktop interfaces
4. Doctor Mobile UI
Build mobile-friendly page for:
Login screen
Audio recording interface: tap-to-start/stop recording
Image upload interface (camera or gallery)
Submit button to upload audio + image (base64) + metadata to backend
Implement client-side retry logic on uploads (handle network failures)
5. Receptionist Desktop UI
Build desktop dashboard interface for:
Login screen (same as doctor)
List view of pending submissions per doctor (show patient number and timestamp)
Patient summary generation button per submission
Editable text box for AI-generated summary preview
Controls to edit, confirm, send via WhatsApp API or print summary
Mark submission as “approved” after sending
6. Backend API
Authenticated endpoints for:
Upload submission (audio + image)
Fetch pending submissions list (filtered by doctor_id)
Generate summary: call Gemini LLM API with base64 audio + image + doctor template + submitted_by context flag
Update submission with edited summary text and status changes
Trigger WhatsApp send via integrated API (or mock for MVP)
Implement robust error handling and async concurrency for API calls
7. AI Integration
Configure Gemini API call with:
Base64 encoded audio + image as input
Doctor’s template to instruct LLM style and format
submitted_by flag to differentiate prompts for doctor vs receptionist inputs
Parse Gemini response into clean, editable summary text
Store AI-generated summary draft in DB for receptionist editing
8. Multi-Tenancy & Data Isolation
Enforce doctor-level data isolation in backend and UI
Each API request filters/returns only data related to authenticated doctor_id
No data leakage across doctors
9. Logging & Monitoring
Implement basic request logging (successful and failed)
Monitor API usage and token consumption from Gemini
Log summary send events (WhatsApp/print)
10. Testing & QA
Unit test backend APIs and frontend components
End-to-end testing of submission → AI summary → receptionist approval → WhatsApp send flow
Test multi-tenancy by creating multiple doctor accounts and submissions
Network failure and retry scenarios testing on uploads and AI calls
11. Deployment & Documentation
Deploy frontend and backend on cloud (Vercel for frontend + Google Cloud Run for backend recommended)
Provide environment setup documentation and deployment instructions
Write user guide for doctor and receptionist workflows
